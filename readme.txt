== Description ==
AnyTimeReply is the automated sales chatbot available to customers round the clock. Its services include Facebook messanger chatbot, collecting leads, managing queries of your customers, answering them, saving the unsolved queries so that you can view and answer them later, auto emailing back to the customers once the answers are available.
Imagine that you are running a business and you can't afford a support-staff to handle client queries, but it needs to be done in order to expand your business as you know that they are your potential customers. Small and medium sized business including startups and individual professional may not be able to afford support system or support staff. Client may need to ask about your office, services and other information about your business round the clock. You may lose you productive hours in giving client support yourself because you do not have a support person and you keep on sending the same information to different clients. One thing that we found in our research is that around 70% queries from clients are repeated, which of course hampers your productive hours very badly. Also, giving same information to clients is waste of time for business. So, after a few years of research, we have come up with AnyTimeReply support system, which is affordable to small to medium sized business and also individual professionals. We at AnyTimeReply believe that customer satisfaction is critical to win customers loyalty, and loyalty is one of driving factors to increase company revenues.
